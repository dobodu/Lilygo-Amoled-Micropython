## Lilygo Amoled Series Micropython firmware with Graphic Support (not LVGL)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's dedicated to

- Lilygo T4-S3 AMOLED
- Lilygo T-Display S3 AMOLED
- Lilygo 1.43-inch SH8601 AMOLED
- Lilygo 1.75-inch SH8601 AMOLED
- Waveshare ESP32-S3 1.8inch AMOLED Touch

This Micropython driver is created on behalf of [nspsck](https://github.com/nspsck/RM67162_Micropython_QSPI) RM67162 driver.
It is also convergent with [russhugues](https://github.com/russhughes/st7789_mpy) ST7789 driver.
I also would like to thanks [lewisxhe](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/LilyGo-AMOLED-Series). Your advices helped me a lot.

My main goal was to adapt a driver library that would give the same functions thant ST7789 driver, in order to
be able to get my micropythons projects working whether on PICO + ST7789 or ESP32 + RM690B0 or ESP32 + RM67162

The driver involves a frame buffer of 600x450, requiring 540ko of available ram (T4-S3 version).
The driver involves a frame buffer of 536x240, requiring 280ko of available ram (TDisplay S3 version).
In a more general way, requirements are WIDTH x HEIGHT x 2 bytes or ram.

Latest firmware is build with
- Micropython 1.25
- ESP IDF toolchain 5.3

## Introduction
This is the successor of the previous [lcd_binding_micropython](https://github.com/nspsck/lcd_binding_micropython). 
It is reconstructed to be more straightforward to develop on, and this allows me to test the changes before committing.

This driver is based on [esp_lcd](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/peripherals/lcd.html).

Available functions: `fill, fill_rect, rect, fill_circle, circle, pixel, vline, hline, colorRGB, bitmap, brightness, line, text, text_len, write, write_len` etc.
For full details please visit [the documentation](#documentation).

Fixed spacing font was created by russhughes.
Variable spacing font was created by myself

The firmware is provided each time when I update this repo.

## Documentation
In general, the screen starts at 0 and goes to 599 x 449 for T4-S3 (resp 535 x 239 for T-Display S3), that's a total resolution of 600 x 450 (resp 536 x 240).
All drawing functions should be called with this in mind.

  Write text using bitmap fonts starting at (x, y) using foreground color `fg_color` and background color `bg_color`.

- `text_len(bitmap_font, s)`

  Returns the string's width in pixels if printed in the specified font.

- `write(bitmap_font, s, x, y[, fg, bg, background_tuple, fill_flag])`

  Write text to the display using the specified proportional or Monospace bitmap font module with the coordinates as the upper-left corner of the text. The foreground and background colors of the text can be set by the optional arguments `fg` and `bg`, otherwise the foreground color defaults to `WHITE` and the background color defaults to `BLACK`.

  The `font2bitmap` utility creates compatible 1 bit per pixel bitmap modules from Proportional or Monospaced True Type fonts. The character size, foreground, background colors, and characters in the bitmap module may be specified as parameters. Use the -h option for details. If you specify a buffer_size during the display initialization, it must be large enough to hold the widest character (HEIGHT * MAX_WIDTH * 2).

## Build
This is only for reference. Since ESP-IDF v5.0.2 to v5.4.1, the path to the cmake files changes.
The instruction below are working with ESP-IDF v5.4.1 and Micropython 1.25.
Please note that for now, compilation crashes with Micropython 1.26_preview
```Shell
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/dobodu/Lilygo-Amoled-Micropython.git

# to the micropython directory
cd micropython/port/esp32
make  BOARD=ESP32_GENERIC_S3 BOARD_VARIANT=FLASH_16M_SPIRAM_OCT USER_C_MODULES=~/Lilygo-Amoled-Micropython CFLAGS_EXTRA=-DMODULE_AMOLED_ENABLED=1
```
You may also want to modify the `sdkconfig` before building in case to get the 16MB storage.
```Shell
cd micropython/ports/esp32
# use the editor you prefer
vim boards/ESP32_GENERIC_S3/sdkconfig.board 
```
Change it to:
```Shell
CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_FLASHMODE_QIO=y
CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_FLASHFREQ_80M=y
CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_AFTER_NORESET=y

CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_FLASHSIZE_4MB=
CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_FLASHSIZE_8MB=
CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_FLASHSIZE_16MB=y
CONFIG_PARTITION_TABLE_CUSTOM=y
CONFIG_PARTITION_TABLE_CUSTOM_FILENAME="partitions-16MiB.csv"
```
If the esp_lcd related functions are missing, do the following:
```Shell
cd micropython/port/esp32
# use the editor you prefer
vim esp32_common.cmake
```
Jump to section `APPEND IDF_COMPONENTS` and add `esp_lcd` to the list should fix this.


# Note: 
Scrolling does not work. Maybe using a framebuffer (provided by Micropython) to scroll will work.
